We elected to implement the boolean assertion using a check constraint. The problem stated that we needed to implement an assertion on our boolean pattern that takes effect on any insertion. We believe, however, that our pattern should apply to ANY update on the record, e.g. it should not be legal to insert a value that fulfills the pattern, and then update it to break the pattern. For this reason, we feel that check constraints is perfect for the task.
