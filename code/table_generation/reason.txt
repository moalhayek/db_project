We elected to implement the boolean assertion using a check constraint. The problem stated that we needed to implement an assertion on our boolean pattern that takes effect on any insertion. We believe, however, that our pattern should apply to ANY update on the record, e.g. it should not be legal to insert a value that fulfills the pattern, and then update it to break the pattern. For this reason, we feel that check constraints is perfect for the task. If we specifically wanted to assert this to be true for insertion, we would have implemented the assertion using a trigger, however, owing to the increased simplicity afforded by the check constraint and its greater suitability for our use case, we believe that our choice of implementation is more than justifiable.
